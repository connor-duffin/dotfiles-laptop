====== Ideas ======
Created Wednesday 10 April 2019

* Need to get back to basics: good diet, steady exercise, good control all back into fashion before trying to move onto the big stuff (meditation, journalling etc).
* Diet: some form of intermittent fasting on the weekend, and time-restricted feeding during the week (try and stick to 12-13 hrs).
* No sugar or processed foods (bread, rice, and pasta allowed due to carb needs).

* Waking up at 5:45 every morning; leaving the house at 6:45am.
* No email until after lunch. No social media at work at all.
* Work: in the office monday to thursday. Emphasis on deep, productive work and try to get as much shit done as possible. Work from 7:30 -> 11:30ish, and then from 12:30 -> 5pm.
* Next semester: only take one tutorial for stat1520. Too much of a time sink and I cannot afford to get as behind / work as much as I am working now.
